<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <button onclick="displayAlert()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        function displayAlert() {
            alert('Button clicked!');
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Performance and Responsiveness

```css
/* Sample CSS code block */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
    h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}
```

- **Performance Optimization**: Frontend developers use various strategies to enhance performance, including minimizing code, optimizing images, and leveraging browser caching.

## Backend Development: The Backbone of Web Applications

### 1. Server-Side Logic and Database Management

Backend development, or server-side development, handles the behind-the-scenes processes that power the frontend. This involves managing server, application, and database operations.

- **Languages and Tools**: Backend development typically involves languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). These languages are used in conjunction with frameworks such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to build robust and scalable applications.

```python
# Sample Python code block (using Flask)
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- **Database Management**: Backend developers are responsible for managing databases, which store the data necessary for a website's operation. Common database management systems include [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).
